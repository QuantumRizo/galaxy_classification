# üåå Starburst and AGN galaxy Classification Using Deep Learning

This project focuses on the **automatic classification of galaxies** into two types:  
**AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei)** and **Starburst galaxies**, using spectroscopic data from the **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)**.

We apply **1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to analyze galaxy spectra in FITS format, with the aim of supporting astrophysical research through automated and reliable classification.

## üß† Methodology

- **Input Data**: 1D flux arrays extracted from FITS files.
- **Model**: 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to capture spatial patterns in the spectra.
- **Preprocessing**: Spectra are resampled and normalized to a consistent shape.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and learning curves.
